  <p><u><strong><span class="path-title">Anxious Attachment Style</span></strong></u> 
    <br>
    You love to be very close to others, and have the capacity for great intimacy, you often fear, however, that others don’t wish to be as close as you would like them to be. Relationships tend to consume a large part of your emotional energy and you can be very sensitive to small fluctuations, in other’s, moods, and actions. Often taking them personally resulting in fear of abandonment or rejection which can make you say and do things you regret.

<div class="path-container">
  <p><u><strong><span class="path-title">Secure Attachment Style</span></strong></u>
    <br>
    Being warm and loving in relationships comes naturally to you. You enjoy having deep connections without becoming overly worried about rejection. You effectively communicate your needs and feelings to others, and are strong at reading other’s emotional cues and responding to them appropriately.

<div class="path-container">
  <p><u><strong><span class="path-title">Avoidant Attachment Style</span></strong></u> 
    <br>
    It is very important for you to maintain your independence and you often prefer autonomy to deep relationships. Even though you do want to be close to others, you feel uncomfortable with too much closeness, and tend to keep others at arms length. You tend not to open up to others and remain emotionally distant in romantic relationships, and you are often on high alert for any signs of being controlled.
